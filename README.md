This template is special in that the graphics are maximally packed to speed up work on weak PCs and slow connections, the template weighs 16kb

the template is backward compatible with all browsers since the late 90s 

Works equally well with Internet Explorer 5 and modern browsers

The code is simple and clear
The template is perfect for learning HTML and maintaining a home page

To use a template, create an **kitty** folder in the **templates** folder, copy files there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.
